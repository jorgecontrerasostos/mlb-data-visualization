# Simple MLB Pitches Data Visualizations Using Polars and Seaborn

## Overview

This notebook is designed to provide a simple yet comprehensive analysis of MLB pitch data. Using the powerful Polars library for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualization, you'll explore different aspects of pitching in baseball. The goal is to demonstrate how to efficiently handle and visualize large datasets in a clean and concise manner.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load MLB pitch data and preprocess it using Polars for fast and efficient data handling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the data and extract key insights.
- **Pitch Type Distribution:** Visualize the distribution of different pitch types across various scenarios.
- **Pitch Speed Analysis:** Analyze and visualize the distribution of pitch speeds for different pitch types.
- **Heatmaps:** Create heatmaps to explore the relationship between pitch location and outcomes.

## Libraries Used

- **Polars:** A fast DataFrame library in Rust and Python that allows for high-performance data processing, particularly with large datasets.
- **Seaborn:** A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- The following Python libraries:
  - Polars: pip install polars
  - Seaborn: pip install seaborn
  - Pandas (if needed for compatibility): pip install pandas
  - Matplotlib (for Seaborn): pip install matplotlib

## Data

The dataset is contained on a book called *Learn to Code With Baseball* writen by Nathan Braun. You can purchase your copy clicking [here](https://codebaseball.com/).
